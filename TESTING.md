Extensive testing was carried out throughout the life cycle of this project. As well as all of the documented testing below I asked friends and family to use the site and tell me what was and wasn't working. I worked through the website clicking and checking each feature and function one by one and looked for anything that wasn't working or that was logging an error in the console. 

Had I given myself more time I would have liked to have implemented some automated testing using Jest and Django automated testing and is certainly something I will look to implement in future. 

In practice and for production code a combination of both manual and automated testing is important. Automated testing can provide fast results especially across large applications whilst manual testing adds the human element and is more adept at spotting things like intuitiveness of the design. Utilising both can ensure high levels of quality and reliability of web applications.


## AUTOMATED TESTING

#### HTML Validator - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)

I was only able to validate the pages that didn't require any form of login or order to be created as with django templates you can't paste the code in directly so had to validate which each pages URL.

| Page | Errors/Warnings | Solution | Image |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Welcome Page | None | N/A | <img src="readme_and_testing_media/testing/welcomehtml.png" alt="HTML validator results for welcome page"> |

#### JSHint Validator - [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)

#### Python Validator - [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) 

I validated all python code that isn't automatically generated with the Code Institute Python Linter and returned no errors so I haven't taken any additional screenshots for these tests.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| No. | Bug. | How I solved the issue |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Missing default value in the product model meant I couldn't migrae my data | Added the missing default value |
| 2 | As I made the sale price field default to 0 in the models the filtering by sale item was no longer working.  | Changed sale_price__isnull=False to sale_price__gt=0 which fixed the issue |
| 3 | Price sorting stopped working | Changed method of how the lowest price per product is determined which fixed the issue |
| 4 | Receiving an error SMTP.starttls() got an unexpected keyword argument 'keyfile' in heroku but emails work in local environment. | Set python version for heroku to same as local environment version. |
| 5 | Quantity form on the bag page no longer worked correctly after styling update as there was now essentially 2 versions of the same form on the page with the same ID just one was hidden on mobile view and the other was hidden on large views. | Removed the ID and identified them using classes instead and updated the JS code to work correctly with the new structure |
| 6 | Checkout page was not saving names and emails when user opted to save their info | Updated the view to also get the name and email from the form and update the user profile accordingly |
| 7 | Contact confirmation email wasn't sending to the user | This was human error in testing, I was using the same email as the store email to test the contact form so only the store was receive the email and the 'user' was not |
| 8 | Couldn't check out as an anonymous user | Initialised discount code to 0 as the error was stating python couldn't access a non existent variable |
| 9 | Modals not working on the add product page | They had been accidently deleted at some point so had to re-code them |
| 10 | Crispy forms with bootstrap 5 doesn't work with this version of Django | Continued to use bootstrap 5 for styling, but some styling was no long working with crispy forms as the classes for bootstrap 4 are slightly different. Manually styled some forms or created the correct classes using widgets/attributes in the python forms. |

### Unsolved Bugs

| 1 | Bag items are removed from the bag once a user logs out |  |
