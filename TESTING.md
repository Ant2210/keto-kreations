Extensive testing was carried out throughout the life cycle of this project. As well as all of the documented testing below I asked friends and family to use the site and tell me what was and wasn't working. I worked through the website clicking and checking each feature and function one by one and looked for anything that wasn't working or that was logging an error in the console. 

Had I given myself more time I would have liked to have implemented some automated testing using Jest and Django automated testing and is certainly something I will look to implement in future. 

In practice and for production code a combination of both manual and automated testing is important. Automated testing can provide fast results especially across large applications whilst manual testing adds the human element and is more adept at spotting things like intuitiveness of the design. Utilising both can ensure high levels of quality and reliability of web applications.


## AUTOMATED TESTING

#### HTML Validator - [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)

I was only able to validate the pages that didn't require any form of login or order to be created as with django templates you can't paste the code in directly so had to validate which each pages URL.

| Page | Errors/Warnings | Solution | Image |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Welcome Page | None | N/A | <img src="readme_and_testing_media/testing/welcomehtml.png" alt="HTML validator results for welcome page"> |

#### Python Validator - [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) 

I validated all python code that isn't automatically generated with the Code Institute Python Linter and returned no errors so I haven't taken any additional screenshots for these tests.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.

## Bugs

### Solved Bugs

| No. | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | The default labels used by ChartJS for the pie chart and bar chart were being cut on smaller screen sizes. | Removed them and created my own key.  |
| 2. | The pie chart was displaying negative figures and "infinity" percentages. | Set the pie chart to show a message of "No income provided" in place of the percentage if income was 0. The pie chart is also now only visible is there is at least 1 transaction. |
| 3. | Fixed circular import error caught at deploy | When using a linter in VS code the routes import in the __ init __.py was being moved to the top. Moved back tot the bottom manually. |
| 4. | Bug - Auto focus on input element of the add budget modal not working. | I was using the wrong element ID so changed the code to match the correct ID. |
| 5. | When signing up with a capital letter in the user name, user taken to 404 page as the user session was saving the user as example "John" but was then checking the database for user "john" when loading the my budgets page. | Fixed by adding .lower() when storing the user in the session upon registration. |
| 6. | When I changed the background from off-white to white the navbar became transparent. | Set the navbar to white also. |
