### Design

#### Colour Scheme
The colour scheme was primarily crafted with a focus on aesthetics and accessibility. I decided to go with a simplistic and minimalist style choice, mostly using the Bootstrap colour pallette, this minimalist and understated approach I feel provided an excellent contrast against the vibrant colours of the food/product pictures, allowing the products themselves to shine through the design.

-   ##### Main Colours Used
    - Text colour 1 - Dark Blue `#084298`
    - Text colour 2 - Bootstrap Standard Black `#212529`
    - Text colour 3 - Bootstrap Standard `text-muted` class `rgba(33, 37, 41, 0.75)`
    - Background colour - `#ffffff`
    - Button colour 1 - Bootstrap `primary` class `#0d6efd`
    - Button colour 2 - Bootstrap `success` class `#198754`
    - Button colour 3 - Bootstrap `danger` class `#dc3545`
    - Button text colour - `#ffffff`
    - Badge colour 1 (sale) - Bootstrap `danger` class `#dc3545`
    - Badge colour 2 (new) - Bootstrap `primary` class `#0d6efd`
    - Badge colour 3 (out of stock) - Bootstrap `warning` class `#FFC107`
    - Badge text colour 1 & 2 - `#ffffff`
    - Badge text colour 3 - Bootstrap Standard Black `#212529`

#### Colour Accessibility
			
To ensure the colours chosen met the WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines as minimum and AAA guidelines where possible as with previous projects I used Coolors Contrast Checker which can be found [here](https://coolors.co/contrast-checker/000000-ffffff). However Coolors doesn't support `rgba` so for these colours I used Siege Media which can be found [here](https://www.siegemedia.com/contrast-ratio).

For further information on these guidelines, you can visit the following link. [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (w3.org)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).

#### Typography
The main considerations for the font were aesthetics and accessibility. I chose the Roboto Condensed font as a personal preference as I like the way it looks on the page. It is also a very widely used font developed by Google.this ensures a fairly wide availability across devises.

 - ##### Fallback Font

    For my fallback font I have opted to stick with the Google recommended fonts when downloading the Roboto Condensed font, if no fonts can be found on the user system is will default to the sans-serif family which has many widely used fonts including Arial. Arial is the most widely used font for both online and printed media. Arial is said to be one of the safest web fonts, and is available on all major operating systems.

### Wireframes
The wireframes were creates using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). I have deviated somewhat from my original wireframes, but this was mainly design preference and ensuring a good responsive layout on smaller screens.

I did not create separate wireframes for mobile and tablet as the layout is identical.

  - #### Desktop Wireframes

### Future Features

-   I would like to incorporate an intelligent function into the app in the future where users are provided helpful and personalised tips and advice about their budgets.
-   I would also like to implement 2 factor authorisation given that a user can store quite sensitive data on this app.
-   I would also like to add a storage facility where users can store documents relating to their budget such as payslips, invoices and receipts.

### Accessibility
-   The use of semantic HTML.
-   Ensuring the colours and text use meet accessibility standards set by [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
-   Ensuring all clickable buttons and links are tabbable using the keyboard.
-   Using descriptive alt tags on all images.
-   Using correct aria labels where necessary.
-   Being mindful in the creation of the design to ensure it is intuitive and as easy to navigate as possible.

### Development Process
As well as using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to create wireframes and flow charts for this project, I also used Figma's Kanban template to keep track of tasks as I found the "sticky note" style more user friendly and it suited my style of task management better.

You can view the Kanban board [here](https://www.figma.com/file/kG9qjy6KkTMRNKzj4HqHlx/Budgify-Kanban?type=whiteboard&node-id=0%3A1&t=cNNHQPXaYC5tNSht-1).

## Testing

Please see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for all testing performed


## Deployment

The project was deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) using a free relational database from [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/). Before deploying to Heroku I would first set up the database so I will explain the deployment in 2 two parts.

### ElephantSQL

1. Navigate to [ElephantSQL.com](https://www.elephantsql.com/) and click “Get a managed database today”

2. Select “Try now for FREE” in the TINY TURTLE database plan.

3. Select “Log in with GitHub” and authorize ElephantSQL with your selected GitHub account.

4. In the Create new team form:
    - Add a team name (your own name is fine)
    - Read and agree to the Terms of Service
    - Select Yes for GDPR
    - Provide your email address
    - Click “Create Team”

5. Your account should now be successfully created.

6. Click “Create New Instance”.

7. Set up your plan:
    - Give your plan a Name (this is commonly the name of the project)
    - Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan
    - You can leave the Tags field blank

8. Select a data centre closest to you - I used EU-West-1 (Ireland).

9. Click "Review".

10. Check your details are correct and then click “Create instance”.

11. Your database should now be successfully created.

12. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.

13. In the URL section, clicking the copy icon will copy the database URL to your clipboard. Keep this tab open as we will need this URL later.

### Heroku

1. To successfully deploy on Heroku we first need to create some files: a requirements.txt file and a Procfile.

2. The requirements.txt file contains all the applications and dependencies that are required to run the app. To create the requirements.txt file run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
    ```

3. The Procfile tells Heroku which files run the app and how to run it. To create the Procfile run the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    echo web: python run.py > Procfile
    ```

    NOTE: This is assuming the file used to launch your app is called run.py, otherwise replace with the correct file name. The Procfile uses a capital P and doesn't have a file extension on the end.

4. If the Procfile has been created correctly it will have the Heroku logo next to it. It is also important to check the Procfile contents, as sometimes on creation a blank line will be added at the end of the file. This can sometimes cause problems when deploying to Heroku, so if the file contains a blank line at the end, delete this and save the file. Make sure to save both these files and then add, commit and push them to GitHub.

5. Login (or sign up) to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com).

6. Click the new button and then click create new app.

7. You will then be asked to give your app a name (these must be unique) and select a region. Once these are completed click create app.

8. You will now need to connect the Heroku app to the GitHub repository for the site. Select GitHub in the deployment section, find the correct repository for the project and then click connect.

9. Once the repository is connected, you will need to provide Heroku some config variables it needs to build the app. Click on the settings tab and then click reveal config vars button. You will now need to add the environment key/value variables that were used in the env.py file:

    | KEY | VALUE |
    | -- | -- |
    | IP | 0.0.0.0 |
    | PORT | 5000 |
    | SECRET_KEY| YOUR_SECRET_KEY* |
    | DATABASE_URL | POSTGRES_DB** |
    | DEBUG | TRUE*** |

    *This ca be anything you want but as the name suggests is a secret.

    **This is where we paste our URL from step 13 in ElephantSQL section.

    ***This variable is to be deleted once debugging is complete and you are ready to deploy your "production" app.

10. You're now ready to click the enable automatic deploys and create button. Heroku will start building the app.

11. We will now need to go the more button on the dashboard and select run console. This is where we will set up the tables in the database we have created on ElephantSQL.

12. Type python3 and then once the python interpreter opens, we can run the following:

    ```bash
    from budgify import db
    db.create_all()
    exit()
    ```

13. Now that the relational database has been set up and the tables created, we can now click open app and the budgify application should now open in a new tab.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. In the top right hand corner of the page locate and click the 'fork' button.
4. Near the bottom of the page click the green button that says 'Create Fork'.
5. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Login to GitHub.
2. Locate the repository, you can use a link you have been provided with or use the search function in the top left of the screen.
3. Near the top of the repository click the green 'Code' button.
4. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under HTTPS copy the link provided.
5. Open the terminal in your code editor. 
6. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
7. Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.
8. Press Enter. Your local clone should be created.
